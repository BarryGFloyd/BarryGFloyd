- Created a Keylogger using Python
  1. Make sure you have python or IDE installed on your computer.
  2. Install pynput by using the command pip install pynput. You know that pynput is installed. If pip doesn‚Äôt work, then try the command: pip3 install pynput.
  3. 3. Optional: If you are working on a Windows computer, then go to settings. In the search bar, type virus & threat protection. Under Virus & Threat protection, click on manage settings and scroll down until you see exclusions. Under exclusions, click on add or remove exclusions and add. Next, click add exclusions. It will provide a drop-down menu and select folder. Add the folder that contains your folder. This prevents your computer from thinking that the keylogger you created is a threat. Also, it prevents the computer from deleting the file after the keylogger has been executed.
  4. After python, atom.io, and pynput were installed on my computer, I copied the python script and created a Keylogger.py file on atom.io
  5.  I used the command prompt and type the command: python3 keylogger.py. Make sure you are in the folder where your keylogger script is before running this script.
  6.  ran the python script in my command prompt using the command: python3 Keylogger.py. The python script is a file I made using the IDE, atom.io. When you run the command, a keylog.txt file appears logging the keystrokes.
